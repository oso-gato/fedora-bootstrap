# fedora-bootstrap — orchestrator. Run as ROOT on a fresh host (Day 0).
# Version: 1.2.8 (policy: Principle 2(c) broadened FLEET-WIDE to the bounded official-upstream-binary class — last-resort/zero-base, GPG-or-checksum verified fail-closed, three consumption shapes, never loose on PATH, disclosed. Parity only: this host/box ships no class-(c) artifact; NO host behavior change. Prior: v1.2.7 PR-first + maintainer-approved-merge maintainership; v1.2.5 verify.sh fail2ban euid-gate fix; v1.2.4 genesis/mother-platform role + fedora-dev maintainership.)

# Runs the two privilege layers in their correct identities (see README "Privilege layers"):
#   setup-host.sh  — the SYSTEM layer, as ROOT: host packages, /etc, system services, the
#                    tailnet node, and CREATES the operating user + its rootless prerequisites.
#   setup-user.sh  — the ROOTLESS layer, as the operating user: user podman socket, ssh keys,
#                    claudebox, Claude policy, verify. Needs NO host privilege.
# Idempotent — re-run safely.
