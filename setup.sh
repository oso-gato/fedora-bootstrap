# fedora-bootstrap — orchestrator. Run as ROOT on a fresh host (Day 0).
# Version: 1.2.0 (SELinux: one-time AUTOMATED disabled->enforcing convergence — permissive-first relabel -> ~15min fail-closed soak -> enforcing -> post-enforce health check with auto-revert to permissive; setup-stamped self-disarming system units; SELINUX_TARGET=permissive opts out. Prior: v1.1.17 docs-only.)

# Runs the two privilege layers in their correct identities (see README "Privilege layers"):
#   setup-host.sh  — the SYSTEM layer, as ROOT: host packages, /etc, system services, the
#                    tailnet node, and CREATES the operating user + its rootless prerequisites.
#   setup-user.sh  — the ROOTLESS layer, as the operating user: user podman socket, ssh keys,
#                    claudebox, Claude policy, verify. Needs NO host privilege.
# Idempotent — re-run safely.
